    <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. It can be<br> played with teams but it is most commonly played as singles and doubles. Each side may only<br> strike the shuttlecock, a feathered plastic projectile with a tip on the end, once before it passes<br> over the net. This sport requires player to have aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed,<br> precision and good motor coordination. Modern badminton was developed in the mid-19th<br> century.</p>
